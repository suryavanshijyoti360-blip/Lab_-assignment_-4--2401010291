📘 Student Record Management System (Assignment-5)

A Java console-based application to manage student records using OOP, interfaces, inheritance, custom exceptions, multithreading, file handling, and collections. This project is built according to the requirements provided in the assignment (exception handling, threading, file I/O, sorting, searching, updating, deleting, and load/save operations).

🚀 Features

✔ Add Student
* Collects roll number, name, email, course, and marks, then calculates grade automatically.

✔ Search Student
* Search by roll number using custom exception StudentNotFoundException.

✔ Update Student
* Updates full details of a student entry.

✔ Delete Student
* Deletes a student record by roll number using safe exception handling.

✔ View All Students
* Displays all records using an Iterator.

✔ Sort by Marks
* Sorts all students by marks (high → low) using a Comparator.

✔ File Handling
* Loads records from students.txt automatically at startup
* Saves all records back to the file before exit

Uses:

* BufferedReader
* BufferedWriter
* File
* Proper text-based persistence
  
✔ Multithreading
* A loader animation is shown while adding and updating records.

✔ Custom Exception
* StudentNotFoundException ensures safe error handling during search, delete, and update operations.

🧰 Technologies Used

* Java OOP
* Abstract class (Person)
* Inheritance (Student extends Person)
* Interface (RecordActions)
* Collections (HashMap, Iterator, List)
* Custom Exception
* Multithreading (Thread, Runnable)
* File Handling (Buffered I/O)
* Sorting using Comparator
* Data validation + try/catch
  
📂 Project Structure (Single File)
StudentRecordSystem.java
students.txt  (auto-created)

The single Java file includes:

1. Person (abstract class)
2. Student class
3. Loader thread class
4. StudentNotFoundException (custom exception)
4. RecordActions (interface)
5. StudentManager (complete CRUD + file handling)
6. Main menu driver
